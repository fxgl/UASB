Unity Asset Server Browser
---------------------------------------------------

Hey everyone, first and foremost the orginal version of this was created by 
Matthew Wegner @ Flashbang Studios. He provided an excellent base to work with,
and I simply added to his outstanding job. You can find his original work here:

http://technology.blurst.com/unity-asset-server-web-browser/

REQUIREMENTS
- PHP w/ PostgreSQL compiled in

INSTALLATION
On your first visit to the site it will create the config.php file for you, or 
if permissions do not allow it, complain. I didn't feel like making a fancy 
installer like WordPress, maybe sometime.

* 	You will need to edit _php/config.php and fill out the settings

* 	You MUST make _tpl_c writable by the server, this is where the template 
	drops the cached files.

SUPPORT
Any issues can be reported @ http://github.com/dotBunny/UASB/issues
Due to time commitments to our normal projects, support may be very limited.

CODE QUALITY

"The entire browser was coded in one day (we spend our Fridays doing 
experimental/learning stuff, and I set out to write a browser one Friday).  As 
a result the code is pretty sloppy in places!  It's also a fork of an older 
PHP framework we created, so you may see some references to other stuff in the 
code.

That said, this is totally usable, and we've been using it for over a year now."

I only add, that this was the first time I used the Smarty template system, 
it's been an experiment adding things so please bear with me.
